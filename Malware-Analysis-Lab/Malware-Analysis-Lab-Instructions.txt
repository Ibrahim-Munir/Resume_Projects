Step 1: Prepare a Custom AMI in a Public Subnet (with Internet Access)
  I couldn't share my AMI, however it is not difficult to create it.
  1. Launch an EC2 instance(preferably Windows) in a public subnet with internet access in a new VPC.
  2. Install and configure Flare VM on this instance.
  3. Once Flare VM is set up correctly, create a snapshot of the instance's root volume and then create a custom AMI from that snapshot.
  4. Replace the necessary placeholders with the appropriate ID's and information.

Replace placeholders such as your_custom_ami_id, your_trusted_IP/32, your_key_pair_name, and others with the relevant IDs and values for your environment.

This Terraform configuration creates a new VPC, a private subnet within that VPC, and launches an EC2 instance using the custom AMI in the specified private subnet. The EC2 instance will have Flare VM pre-installed and will not have direct internet access, ensuring a more secure environment for malware analysis. Adjust the security group rules as needed for Flare VM access.

If you want to avoid the long install times of "Flare VM" you could instead install "Retoolkit" on the AMI. I personally have not tried it but it should work.
